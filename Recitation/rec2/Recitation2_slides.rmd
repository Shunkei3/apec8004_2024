# Quick review of Assignment 1


"Show that the derived Walrasian equilibrium allocation is PO" (or maybe you could be asked "Show that the first welfare theorem holds for this economy")

<br>

For this type of question, you have several approaches:

**Approach 1**: plug $x^{\ast}$ into the contract curve and confirm that it returns $y^{\ast}$

**Approach 2**: Check $MRS_1=MRS_2$
+ Only valid for interior outcomes. For corner outcomes, this does not hold. 

**Approach 3**: If preferences are all LNS, then you can invoke the 1st welfare theorem. 

**Approach 4**: Argue that any movement away from the equilibrium makes someone worse off.

# Exercise problem

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-2.ph2.mt2[

Consider the following specific $2 \times 2$ competitive exchange economy, with consumers $j=1,2$ and goods $x$ and $y$. The consumers' preferences and initial endowments are given as follows:

+ Consumer 1: $U_1(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_1=(12,4)$
+ Consumer 2: $U_2(x_2, y_2)=max[x_2, y_2]\quad \text{and} \quad\omega_2=(4,12)$

1. Find the set of Pareto-optimal allocations for this economy. You do not need to provide a mathematical derivation. Construct a carefully labeled Edgeworth-box diagram depicting the economy, including the endowment and at least one indifference curve for each consumer. Indicate the contract curve in your diagram.

2. True or False: This economy has a Walrasian equilibrium? If true, find the equilibrium price vector and allocation. If false, explain why the equilibrium does not exist.

# June 2022 Prelim 

Consider a $2 \times 2$ competitive exchange economy, where subscript $j = 1, 2$ indexes consumers and goods are $x$ and $y$. Preferences are represented by the utility functions $U_2(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1$ and $U_2(x_2, y_2)=x_2+2y_2$. The initial endowment vectors are $\omega_1=(6,10)$ and $\omega_2=(6,0)$.

1. In an Edgeworth box diagram, indicate the endowment $\omega$ and draw indifference curves for each consumer. Also draw the contract curve, the set of Pareto-optimal allocations. Label your diagram carefully. 

2. Derive the demands $x_j(p, \omega_j)$ for the two consumers. Be sure to include demand behavior when prices are zero. 

3. Derive the Walrasian equilibrium price-allocation vector $(p^{\ast}, x^{\ast})$. Indicate and label the equilibrium, both $x^{\ast}$ and $p^{\ast}$, in your Edgeworth box from part (a).

4. Consider the PO allocation $x_1^{\prime}=(6,3)$ and $x_2^{\prime}=(6,7)$. Find a price vector, and also an alternative endowment vector $\omega^{\prime}$, that together will support this allocation as a Walrasian equilibrium.
