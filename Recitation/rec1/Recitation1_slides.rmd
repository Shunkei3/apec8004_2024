+ We covered Pareto optimiality and walrasian equilibrium. Both concepts are about how to allocate resources to individuals in a economy with some criterion.

.content-box-green[**How they are related?**] 

+ **The first welfare theorem**: If preferences satisfy LNS, then a Walrasian equilibrium is PO. 
+ **The second welfare theorem**: If preferences are (i) continuous, (ii) convex, and (iii) strongly monotonic, then a PO allocation can be a Walrasian equilibrium.

# Quasilinear preferences:

For the definition, see Mas-Colell P45.

.content-box-green[**Quasilinear utility function (in two commodity case):**] 

$$u(x, y) = \underbrace{\quad x \quad}_\text{numeraire} + \underbrace{\quad  f(y) \quad }_{f(\cdot)\text{ is strictly concave} \\ y \text{ does not depend on income (wealth)}}$$

+ In this case, we say preferences are quasilinear with respect to commodity $x$.
+ $x$ is preferable for consumers (e.g., $x$ is a private good and $y$ is a public good). 
+ Commodity $x$ is called <span style="color:blue">numeraire</span>. 


???
+ Next, let's do a quick review of quasilinear utility function. In the Mas-Colell, this kind of stuff is introduced shortly. You see a lot in Public goods. 

+ Here is the quasilinear utility function.

.content-box-green[**Characteristics:**]
+ In the two commodity case, the indifference curves are parallel along the axis of $x$.
  + The numeraire goods shift the indifference curves outward as consumption increases, without changing their slope.

+ For any set of prices, the consumers' preferred level of $y$ (e.g., public goods) will not depend on income.

\begin{align*}
u(x, y) = x + f(y)
\end{align*}

Why commodity $y$ is free from income effect?

<!-- What is the amount of commodity $y$ which a consumer is willing to give up for one unit more of good $x$? -->

\begin{align*}
MRS \text{ of } y \text{ for } x
  &= - \frac{dx}{dy} \bigg \rvert_{u=\bar{u}} \\
  &= - \frac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}}\\
  &= - \frac{f^{\prime}(y)}{1} \\
  &= - f^{\prime}(y)
\end{align*}

<span style="color:blue">That is, at a given level of $y$, every indifference curve will have the same slope regardless of the level of $x$.</span>

# Exercise problem 

Consider an exchange economy economy with two consumers, $j=1,2$, two goods, $x$ and $y$. Consumer $1$ has an endowment of $\omega_1$ has an endowment of $\omega_1 = (12,0)$ and consumer $2$ has an endowment of $\omega_2=(0,8)$. Utility functions are given by 

$$U_1(x_1, y_1)=x_1 + ln y_1 \text{ and } U_2(x_2, y_2)=log x_2 + y_2$$ 

<br>

a. Derive the contract curve for this economy. 

b. Derive the demands (offer curves) for the two consumers. Solve for a Walrasian equilibrium allocation and prices $(x^{\ast}, p^{\ast})$. You may include a carefully labeled diagram as part of your answer if you wish, but this is not required. Show that the Walrasian equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal

c. Consider the allocation at which consumer $1$ gets the entire resources endowment: $x_1=(12,8)$ and $x_2=(0,0)$. Can this be the allocation for a Walrasian equilibrium? If not, explain why. If so, find the price vector and a redistributed endowment vector $\tilde{\omega}$ that supports it as an equilibrium. 

???
+ Okay, this is the exercise problem I want to do this today. The main focus is on part (a) and (b). Part (c) is also an important question and it is a question related to the second welfare theorem. If we cannot finish part (c) today, then we can talk about it next time.

# Tricky utility functions: 

For example,

+ $U(x, y) = max[x, y]$ 
  + like Leontief utility function, but $max[x, y]$ instead of $min[x, y]$

+ $U(x, y) = (x + 2)(y_1 + 2)$ 
  + a type of the Stoneâ€“Geary utility function

# Exercise problem (maybe next time)

\begin{align*}
U_1(x_1, y_1) &= x_1 y_1, \quad \omega_1 = (12, 4) \\
U_2(x_2, y_2) &= max[x_2, y_2], \quad \omega_2 = (4, 12)
\end{align*}

<br>

1. What is the set of PO allocations?
2. What is the Walrasian equilibrium if any.
